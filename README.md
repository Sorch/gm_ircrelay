What is it?
-----------
A simple irc relay for relaying chat messages from a garrysmod server to a channel on an irc network..
It also relays from irc to garrysmods



How do I use it?
----------------
	edit 'gm_ircrelay/lua/autorun/ircrelay/config.lua' then upload to your garrysmod addon folder
	and start your server..
	
	
What do I need for this to work?
---------------------------------
**You need to have [gm_bromsock](https://github.com/Bromvlieg/gm_bromsock) **

I do suggest compiling yourself if not there is compiled binaries on the authors repo..

But if they do not work for you I have working copies compiled against "Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS x86_64" using the "4.8.0-46-generic #49~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP"
if you want them just message me here :)
